   of the flags field for both messages)
    * A flag of 0 represents single point position
    * A flag of 1 represents the float solution

   documented at http://github.com/swift-nav/libsbp. See the libsbp README for
   more details.

#### Console / serial_link.py

 * Annotate settings to provide a description and notes for each setting
 * Add Json serialization option to serial link functionality
 * Provide a progress indicator for firmware updates
 * Add a pause and clear button to the console log
 * Add Piksi serial number to the console window header
 * Use libsbp to decode messages from Piksi
 * Watchdog timer option on Piksi heartbeat messages
 * If running console from the source, update dependencies or rerun the setup.sh
   script to grab the necessary dependencies

v0.14 <a name="v0.14"></a>
-----

 * Numerous fixes to setup script for Ubuntu, OS X, ARM and RasberryPi targets

#### Core

 * Make low latency mode the default
 * Added chi-squared test on baseline solution residual to catch a large class
   of potential errors, including some cycle slips and incorrect IAR
   initializations
 * Handle the `DMA RX buffer overrun` and `observation message packing: integer
   overflow` errors more gracefully, these are no longer a critical errors and
   the system will continue to operate correctly
 * Fixes a bug that periodically caused a `Obs Matching: t_base < t_rover`
   error message and prevented any `BASELINE` messages from being generated
 * Improvements to integer ambiguity resolution speed when adding new
   satellites
 * New tracking loop filter architecture

#### Console / serial_link.py

 * Added options to log SBP data to a file in the console and serial_link.py
 * Ephemerides are now saved alongside observation files from console
 * serial_link.py now has options to reset the device upon connection and to
   exit after a timeout has elapsed
 * More compact layout of GUI elements

v0.13 <a name="v0.13"></a>
-----

 * Fix a bug resulting in a stack overflow when satellite set changes
 * Fix a bug in the NMEA output when the longitude magnitude was >127
 * Simulator mode enable is now a setting rather than a button in the console
 * Numerous improvements to the development environment setup script including
   now using Ansible to provision the required tools

v0.12 <a name="v0.12"></a>
-----

 * Fixes a bug where a "disorder in the sdiffs" message is displayed and the
   RTK solution output stops
 * Fixes an issue where Piksi would stop outputting observations and solutions
   for a period of several minutes before resuming
 * Adds a "lock count" field to the observation message format, allowing the
   remote receiver to detect when a satellite has been reinitialized. This
   fixes a problem where the RTK solution would become large and erronious when
   one receiver is restarted or satellites are rapidly lost and re-gained
 * Fixes issue where console would freeze on start-up
 * Increases the precision of settings values, fixing an issue where the base
   station position would lose precision if the settings were saved and the
   Piksi was then reset
 * Added a "Reset to factory defaults" button to the console
 * Fixes the center on solution button in the console
 * Fixes the start date in RINEX file headers
 * Improves handling of the Piksi being unplugged in the console

v0.11 <a name="v0.11"></a>
-----

 * Add ‘low latency mode’ which provides very low latency baseline outputs
   irrespective of the radio communications delay with a small accuracy penalty
 * Fix a stack overflow bug that occurs when the number of satellites in common
   falls below 5
 * Improve the robustness of the firmware update procedure

v0.10 <a name="v0.10"></a>
-----

#### Core

 * FFT based acquisition core for ~100x increase in acquisition speed
 * Increased from 9 to 11 tracking channels
 * Long SPI transfers to the NAP now use DMA
 * Numerous improvements to the simulator to make it more closely match the
   non-simulated behaviour
 * Fix bug where settings were not always saved to flash
 * Fix numerous stability issues
 * Firmware now checks for compatible NAP version
 * Added monitoring of UART throughput and observation latency
 * New compacted observation format for increased throughput and flexible over
   the wire frame size
 * Refactored UART code to allow peripherals (e.g. Bluetooth or 3G modules) to
   claim a UART for exclusive use
 * Remove the old Float Kalman Filter with position states that was running in
   the background, now we exclusively run the new KF which only uses ambiguity
   states and constraint equations

   period
 * Add ability to periodically transmit a message indicating the surveyed
   location of a base station
 * Add support for external modules to the build system
 * Add mechanism to register NMEA dispatchers (used by the external iAP
   Bluetooth module to interface to Apple devices)
 * If we have received a message with the surveyed location of the base station
   then output "pseudo-absolute" NMEA messages

#### libswiftnav

 * Generate a fixed solution even if only a partial set of PRNs have had their
   integer ambiguity resolved
 * Add FLL-aided-PLL loop filter
 * Fixed bug where the reference satellite was not found

- group: surveyed_position
  name: broadcast
  type: boolean
  units:
  default value: 'false'
  enumerated possible values: true,false
  Description: Broadcast surveyed base station location
  Notes: This flag ultimately determines whether the SBP message with identifier
    MSG_BASE_POS will be calculated and sent.  Logically, setting this attribute to
    "true" sets the Local Piksi as a base station and configures the unit to send
    its surveyed location coordinates to the other Piksi(s) with which the base
    station is communicating.  If "true", the remote Piksi that receives the
    surveyed position will calculate and communicate a pseudo absolute
    RTK position based upon the received position.

- group: surveyed_position
  name: surveyed_lat
  type: Double
  units: degrees
  default value: '0'
  enumerated possible values:
  Description: "Surveyed latitude of the Piksi's antenna"
  Notes: This setting represents the latitude of the local Piksi's antenna. If
    surveyed position "broadcast" is set to "true", the coordinate will be
    communicated to remote Piksis with which to calculate their pseudo-absolute
    RTK position.  The value should be as accurate as possible and should have
    precision to at least 7 digits following the decimal point. For reference,
    1e-7 degrees of latitude is about 1.1cm on the surface of the earth. Any
    errors in the surveyed position will directly affect the pseudo-absolute
    RTK position measurement reported by the remote Piksi.

- group: surveyed_position
  name: surveyed_lon
  type: Double
  units: degrees
  default value: '0'
  enumerated possible values:
  Description: "Surveyed longitude of the Piksi's antenna"
  Notes: This setting represents the longitude of the local Piksi's antenna. If
    surveyed position "broadcast" is set to "true", the coordinate will be
    communicated to remote Piksis with which to calculate their pseudo-absolute
    RTK position.  The value should be as accurate as possible and should have
    precision to at least 7 digits following the decimal point. For reference,
    1e-7 degrees of longitude at 35 degree latitude is about 1 cm.  Any
    errors in the surveyed position will directly affect the pseudo-absolute
    RTK position measurement reported by the remote Piksi.

- group: surveyed_position
  name: surveyed_alt
  type: Double
  units: meters
  default value: '0'
  enumerated possible values:
  Description: "Surveyed altitude of the Piksi's antenna"
  Notes: This setting represents the altitude of the Piksi's antenna above the
    WGS84 ellipsoid. If surveyed position "broadcast" is set to "true", this
    coordinate will be communicated to remote Piksi's against which to calculate
     a pseudo-absolute position. This value should be precise to 1 cm. Any
     errors in the surveyed position will directly affect the pseudo-absolute
     RTK position measurement reported by the Rover.

- group: float_kf
  name: phase_var
  type: Double
  units: cycles^2
  default value: '0.0144'
  enumerated possible values:
  Description: Assumed variance of a satellite's phase measurement
  Notes: This setting adjusts variance estimates in the Swift Kalman filter which
    aids in integer ambiguity resolution (IAR).  Increasing this value can reduce
    the occurrence of false carrier phase locks but can also increase the time required
    to achieve an IAR fixed solution.  This setting should not be adjusted by end
    users.

- group: float_kf
  name: code_var
  type: Double
  units: meters^2
  default value: '40000'
  enumerated possible values:
  Description: Assumed variance of a satellite's pseudorange measurement
  Notes: This setting adjusts variance estimates in the Swift Kalman filter which
    aids in integer ambiguity resolution (IAR).  Increasing this value can reduce
    the occurrence of false carrier phase locks but can also increase the time required
    to achieve an IAR fixed solution.  This setting should not be adjusted by end
    users.

- group: float_kf
  name: amb_init_var
  type: Double
  units: non dimensional
  default value: '1.00E+08'
  enumerated possible values:
  Description: Initial integer ambiguity variance at filter initialization
  Notes: This setting adjusts variance estimates in the Swift Kalman filter which
    aids in integer ambiguity resolution (IAR).  Increasing this value can reduce
    the occurrence of false carrier phase locks but can also increase the time required
    to achieve an IAR fixed solution.  This setting should not be adjusted by end
    users.

- group: float_kf
  name: new_amb_var
  type: Double
  units: non dimensional
  default value: '1.00E+10'
  enumerated possible values:
  Description: Variance for new ambiguity measurements
  Notes: This setting adjusts variance estimates in the Swift Kalman filter which
    aids in integer ambiguity resolution (IAR).  Increasing this value can reduce
    the occurrence of false carrier phase locks but can also increase the time required
    to achieve an IAR fixed solution.  This setting should not be adjusted by end
    users.

- group: frontend
  name: antenna_selection
  type: enum
  units:
  default value: Auto
  enumerated possible values: Auto,Patch,External
  Description: Determines which antenna to use.
  Notes: This setting selects the antenna input that should be used by the Piksi.  When
    set to "Auto", if the unit senses an external antenna attached to the Piksi
    from a load placed on the antenna output DC bias, it will use the
    external antenna.  If no external antenna is attached (or a passive antenna
    is attached), it will use the integrated patch antenna.  Selecting "Patch"
    or "External" for this setting can override the automatic antenna selection
    and force the external or patch antenna to be used.

- group: iar
  name: phase_var
  type: double
  units: cycles^2
  default value: '0.0144'
  enumerated possible values:
  Description: Determines the measured carrier phase variance for use in the integer
    ambiguity resolution test loop
  Notes: This setting adjusts variance estimates in the integer ambiguity resolution
    (IAR) subroutine.  Increasing this value can reduce the occurrence of false carrier
    phase locks but can also increase the time required to achieve an IAR fixed solution.  This
    setting should not be adjusted by end users.

- group: iar
  name: code_var
  type: double
  units: meters^2
  default value: '40000'
  enumerated possible values:
  Description: Determines the pseudocode variance for the integer ambiguity resolution
    subroutine
  Notes: This setting adjusts variance estimates in the integer ambiguity resolution
    (IAR) subroutine.  Increasing this value can reduce the occurrence of false carrier
    phase locks but can also increase the time required to achieve an IAR fixed solution.  This
    setting should not be adjusted by end users.

- group: sbp
  name: obs_msg_max_size
  type: integer
  units: bytes
  default value: '104'
  enumerated possible values:
  Description: Determines the maximum message length for raw observation sbp messages.
  Notes: This parameter is useful for tuning observation messages for compatibility
    with radio modems.  Some serial modems will internally split serial packets for
    their protocol and this parameter allows the size of the message to be reduced
    as to prevent the modem from sending multiple packets. If the parameter exceeds
    255 bytes (the maximum size of an SBP message), the Piksi firmware will ignore
    the parameter and use 255 bytes.  If the parameter is set smaller than the size
    of one observation, the Piksi firmware will ignore the parameter and use the size
    of one observation as the maximum message size.

- group: simulator
  name: enabled
  type: boolean
  units:
  default value: 'false'
  enumerated possible values: true,false
  Description: Toggles the Piksi internal simulator on and off
  Notes: The Piksi simulator will provide simulated outputs of a
    stationary base station and the Local Piksi moving in a circle around the
    base station The simulator is intended to aid in system integration by
    providing realistic looking outputs but does not faithfully simulate every
    aspect of device operation.

- group: solution
  name: soln_freq
  type: integer
  units: hz
  default value: '10'
  enumerated possible values:
  Description: The rate at which a solution is generated internally to the Piksi.
  Notes:

- group: solution
  name: output_every_n_obs
  type: integer
  units:
  default value: '2'
  enumerated possible values:
  Description: Integer divisor of solution frequency for which the observations will
    be output.
  Notes: For instance, if the solution frequency is 10 hz, and the "output every n
    obs" parameter is 2, it means that the observation output will occur at a rate
    of 5hz.  Since the observations are the information used by the Piksi receiving
    corrections from the connected Piksi, this determines the rate of information
    sharing for RTK solution output. This parameter is designed to tune the rate at
    which correction information is passed from one Piksi to the other as to efficiently
    use radio modem bandwidth and fit with user applications.

- group: solution
  name: dgnss_solution_mode
  type: enum
  units:
  default value:
  enumerated possible values: Low Latency, Time Matched
  Description: Determines the type of RTK solution which will be output.
  Notes: A "Low Latency" solution uses an internal model of anticipated satellite observations
    to provide RTK output with minimal latency but slightly reduced accuracy.  "Low Latency" mode
    assumes that the base station is stationary. For applications where accuracy is desired over timelieness
    or when both Piksi's are moving, "Time matched" mode can be chosen.  This
    means that the RTK output will require a corresponding set of correction observations
    for each timestamp.

- group: solution
  name: dgnss_filter
  type: enum
  units:
  default value: Fixed
  enumerated possible values: Fixed,Float
  Description: Determines the type of carrier phase ambiguity resolution that the Piksi will attempt to achieve.
  Notes: If "fixed", the Piksi will output a integer fixed ambiguity estimate.  If
    no fixed solution is available, it will revert to the float solution.  If "float",
    the device will only output the float ambiguity estimate.

  Notes:

- group: uart_ftdi
  name: sbp_message_mask
  type: integer
  units:
  default value: 65535 (decimal), 0xFFFF (hex)
  enumerated possible values:
  Description: Configure the message mask for SBP messages on the UART for the USB
    port on Piksi
  Notes: 'The message mask is bitwise anded to the message identifier for a particular
    message.  If the result is non-zero, the message will be sent over this UART.
    For example, consider the Piksi firmware sending an SBP
    message with ID 0x0041. If UART A has mask "64" (0x0040),
    The SBP subsystem bitwise-ands the message id with the UART A mask giving the result
    of 0x0040. Since the result is non-zero, the message is valid for UART A and is sent.
    Practically, the UART with mask 64 (0x0040) transmits
    only RTK observation data and the USART with mask 65280 (0xFF00) transmits
    most messages of interest to the host system (such as position and velocity).
    A mask of 0xFFFF will transmit all messages at the expense of bandwidth.'

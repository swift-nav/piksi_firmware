# Entry point for provisioning specification. First, groups by host
# platform and then chooses a provisioning role based on host key. A
# "role" here is a set of tasks to be performed in order, just like a
# bash script, but (i) allows you to easily control logging level,
# (ii) stores some state about its run so it can be safely run and
# then repeated, (iii) permits easy dependency ordering of tasks:
# i.e., all the reliability issues that are a pain with bash.
#
